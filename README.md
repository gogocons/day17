# tsx instructions for reference

Local installation

If you're using it in an npm project, install it as a development dependency:

`npm install --save-dev tsx`

You can reference it directly in the package.json#scripts object:

{
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "tsx ..."
    }
}

To use the binary, you can call it with npx while in the project directory:

`npx tsx ...`
